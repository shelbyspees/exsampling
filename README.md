# ExSampling

Some example code demonstrating trace-aware sampling strategies and common mistakes.

## Try it out yourself

Requirements:
* Ruby >= 2.3
* Bundler >= 1.13
* Your Honeycomb API key
* The name of your Honeycomb team (as it appears in URLs)

Pass your Honeycomb information in via environment variables and run the script to see the examples execute in realtime.

```console
$ HONEYCOMB_WRITE_KEY=<key> HONEYCOMB_TEAM=<team> ruby exsampling.rb
```

## TODO

Update with new examples
